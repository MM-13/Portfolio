                <h3>Tech & Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    Perhaps one of my biggest interests next to programming, is technology!
                    <br>I try to keep up with the latest advancements in the tech industry and love to go hands-on with the newest technologies.
                    I'm always eager to learn new skills and expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of technology.
                    <br>
                    <br>In my spare time, I like a good challenge! That's why I enjoy programming with Python or making websites so much.
                    It's a way to express myself, find my limits and extend them. It's the next best thing after game development/production for me to combine my creative side with my technical skills.
                    
                </p>
                <h3>Family, Friends & Hobby's</h3>
                <p>
                    I love playing basketball, which I've played on a competitive level for many years of which a few as team leader, and volleyball.
                    Spending time with my friends is something I can always enjoy! Travelling together, doing activities...
