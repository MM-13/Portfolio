        description: "You're a hungry penguin and you're trying to collect as many fish and bring them back home before the other penguins do the same! Slide, bump and grind your way to the top of the iceberg! Bonkers for loot is a goofy couch party game that pits you against where you slide around and try to catch the most fish! We made this game as an exam project, which we all enjoyed working on, developing the game-play and making sure the game was not only fun to make, but also fun to play! Play with up to 4 people with a controller or with mouse and keyboard.",

Prepare for the coming storms, manage your resources, and find your way off the island! Tides of Oblivion is a prototype we made for a Game Jam for our Game Design 2 course where we received the task of making a game in less than 2 days. We had a lot of fun making this game, with of course the added bonusses of having to fix bugs coming out of nowhere. It might not be fully ready, but we hope you enjoy!",

The game is absolutely no artistic masterpiece, it was made because I love programming in different languages and I wanted to try out something new. I also wanted to make the game playable in the browser, which after some struggles just worked!",
